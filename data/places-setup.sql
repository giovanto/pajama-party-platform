If you want action, why not take to the waves on a <a href="https://www.kapalouest.com/" target="_blank"> catamaran? </a>
</p>
<p>
Or if you''d rather keep your feet on the ground, you could <a href="https://balades.larochelle-tourisme.com/pied" target="_blank">go for a wander</a>
around La Ville Blanche (as La Rochelle is known) and get some great views by climbing the two towers that used to protect the harbour from the troublesome English.

As France''s largest fishing port, Boulogne-sur-Mer has been a popular place for Parisians to while away a weekend eating the fruits of the sea/seafood. But if you prefer seeing your sea creatures living and want to know what''s going on under the waves, why not visit Nausicaa?
</p>
<p>
The old town with its walls still in tact is a nice place to wander around taking in the Cathedral and UNESCO listed Belfry and eat at one of the many tourist-friendly restaurants.
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you could head down to the port to get something fresh off the boat at Quay Gambetta.
</p>
<p>
The port was badly damaged in the Second World War and Boulogne''s town planners, like in much of post-war Europe, decided that the best response to the brutality of war would be to rebuild in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture" target="_blank">brutalist</a> style.
</p>
<p>
But while most brutalist buildings were quietly bulldozed away elsewhere, Boulogne still proudly flaunts its wares and pulls it off rather well in the four blocks of flats facing the quay, know by their surprisingly anglicised name <a href="https://www.pss-archi.eu/villes/FR-62160.html" target="_blank">''Les Buildings''</a>.
</p>
<p>
But if you didn''t want to come to see anglicisation, what about a bit of Welsh? Welsh rarebit is a bit of a hit around here, as is moules-frites which seems popular with the Belgian tourists who now make up the bulk for foreign visitors.
</p>
<p>
Older travellers may wistfully remember when Boulogne was also a terminal for ferries from Dover and Folkestone.

<p>And after a tipple or two, perhaps the next stop ought to be the nearby <a href="https://biltoki.com/halles/bacalan/" target="_blank">Halles de Bacalan</a> for a wide selection of tasty grub. Why not try a local <a href="https://www.bordeaux-tourism.co.uk/local-specialities" target="_blank">canelé</a> - a rum and vanilla flavoured pastry with a custard centre and caramelised crust - yum.</p>
<p>For hundreds of years, the wine trade brought Bordeaux wealth in abundance which is tastefully on display in the city''s collection of buildings, particularly along a moon-shaped bend in the river known as <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1256/" target="_blank">Port de la Lune</a>.

<p>And to complement the high-end wines and architecture, how about taking in some high-brow opera, or ballet at the <a href="https://www.opera-bordeaux.com/" target="_blank">Opera House</a> where tickets start at 8 euros?</p>
<p>Bordeaux has had more sobering periods of history, as evidenced by the<a href="https://www.bordeaux-tourism.co.uk/cultural-heritage/submarine-base.html" target="_blank">U-boat submarine base</a>, which proved too difficult to destroy after the war and now stands as a permanent reminder. However, the cavernous interiors have been turned into an opportunity for a more creative and imaginative use and now house<a href="https://www.bassins-lumieres.com/" target="_blank">Les Bassins des Lumières</a> - the largest fixed multimedia installation in the world. To get there take Tram C to Raveziès and then n°9 bus.</p>

<p>Ancient history can feel remote from our times, and some Roman sites are a bit dry. However, here the Roman past is brought to life through the smallest (and saddest) of Tarragona''s many finds. A children''s doll was found in the grave of a four or five-year-old girl.

For a start, you can leave behind your Basque dictionary as Spanish is the only official language here.</p>

<p>If you can''t wait until then and find yourself coming through here in the last week in July, then you might get caught up in the Santa Ana festival. It''s hard to know what <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ana_%28madre_de_Mar%C3%ADa%29" target="_blank">Jesus'' gran</a>would make of the festivities in her honour, but hopefully she''d approve of Tudela''s very particular dance craze - <a href="https://www.diariodenavarra.es/noticias/navarra/tudela-ribera/tudela/2019/07/24/la-revoltosa-tudela-que-origen-658910-1769.html" target="_blank"> La Revoltosa</a>, which can be summarised as running around the bandstand in la Plaza de los Fueros, in time with the band that speeds up and slows as it sees fit until everyone runs out of steam.</p>
<p>As with other festivals in Navarre, it''s traditional to wear white with a red necktie and mornings start with a bull run through the town ready for a bullfight later that day.</p>
<p>Tudela has another festival with a ''difference'' at Easter. On Easter Saturday, an effigy of someone/something topical (originally Judas) is presented to the crowd with a firecracker in its mouth, then set alight and tossed into the crowd for a bit of a bashing.</p>

<p>Apart from festivals, the old town is nice to wander around with it''s mixture of great buildings and not-so-great buildings decorated in street art.</p>
<p>There''s also a lot of architectural one-upmanship. The Church of la Magdalena (which was the Christian church during Moorish times) has an impressive freeze.</p>
<p>It''s only outdone by the Cathedral, which was built on top of the old mosque. The depictions leave you in no doubt about your fate if you aren''t faithful.</p>
<p>While some people were keen on removing all trace of the Moorish past after the re-conquest, Englishman and local clergyman, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_of_Ketton" target="_blank">Robert of Ketton</a>preferred to learn about and share Moorish and Islamic works, writing the first translation of the Koran into a western language (Latin).</p>
<p>Curiosity about Tudela''s Moorish past and the way Muslims, Jews and Christians co-existed have led to excavations being carried out on what is believed to be the old Jewish quarter. One individual who probably lived there was <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjam%C3%ADn_de_Tudela" target="_blank">Benjamin of Tudela</a>who is the town''s very own Marco Polo and wrote about his <a href="https://www.forgottenbooks.com/en/readbook/TheItineraryofRabbiBenjaminofTudela_10621142" target="_blank">travels to China</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.bellasartes.gob.ar/en/" target="_blank">Museo de Bellas Artes</a>offers some of the finest religious works of art with paintings by El Greco, Velázquez, and Goya, but also some more down to earth every day pictures about Seville like Gonzalo Bilbao’s Las cigarreras (The Cigarette Makers). For another place with masterpieces in a building that''s also a masterpice in its own right, try the <a href="http://www.hospitaldelosvenerables.es" target="_blank">Hospital de los Venerables Sacerdotes.</a></p>
<p>And if Seville is getting too steamy for you, you could always try cooling off in the Parque de María Luisa.&nbsp;</p>

And if you want some more direction, <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/articles/on-the-tapas-trail-in-seville" target="_blank">here''s a guide</a>to some of the finest.</p>
<p>For flamenco try <a href="http://www.casadelamemoria.es" target="_blank">Casa de la Memoria</a>or <a href="http://www.flamencoensevilla.com" target="_blank">Casa de la Guitarra</a>and if you are looking for festivals then Semana Santa (Holy Week) and the Feria de Abril (Spring Fair) should do the trick.</p>
