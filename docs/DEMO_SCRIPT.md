# Action Group Demo Script: Pajama Party Platform

## Presentation Overview

**Duration**: 3 minutes  
**Audience**: Back-on-Track Action Group (Giovanni, Ellie, Howard, Peter, Simone)  
**Goal**: Get approval for full development and September 2025 integration

## Demo Script

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)
*"I want to show you something that could change how we reach beyond our rail enthusiast bubble and build grassroots communities across Europe."*

*[Display laptop screen with platform]*

*"What if we could ask every young European: 'Where would you like to wake up tomorrow?' and turn their dreams into advocacy data and local activist communities?"*

### Live Demo (90 seconds)

#### Step 1: Form Submission (30 seconds)
*"Let me show you how this works. I'm someone who's never heard of Back-on-Track, but I see this question..."*

*[Fill out form]*
- **Origin**: "Amsterdam Central"
- **Destination**: "Barcelona"

*"Simple, appealing, no mention of policy or advocacy yet."*

*[Submit form]*

#### Step 2: Map Visualization (30 seconds)
*"Now watch what happens..."*

*[Show map update with new pin]*

*"My dream is now part of a European map showing where people want to travel sustainably. Look at these clusters..."*

*[Point to popular destinations]*

*"47 people want night trains from Amsterdam. 23 want to wake up in Barcelona. This is concrete advocacy data we can use."*

#### Step 3: Community Building (30 seconds)
*"But here's the real power..."*

*[Show community message]*

*"'2 people from Amsterdam Central want to organize a pajama party.' This creates local activist networks automatically."*

*[Show Discord integration]*

*"They're invited to our Action Group Discord where they get the updated pajama party kit and coordinate with others."*

### Strategic Value (45 seconds)

#### Problem Solved
*"Remember Howard's insight? Our night train map is 'too good' - it doesn't show the gaps. This platform does."*

#### Three Benefits
1. **Advocacy Data**: *"X people want connection Y - concrete policy asks"*
2. **Community Building**: *"Station-based activist networks forming organically"*  
3. **Mainstream Outreach**: *"Romantic framing attracts non-activists to sustainable travel"*

### September Integration (15 seconds)
*"Perfect timing: this launches in August, builds communities through summer, then activates them for our September 26th Berlin Conference pajama party - but now Europe-wide instead of just 6 cities."*

## Backup Talking Points

### If Technical Issues
- **Screenshots prepared**: Show mockups if live demo fails
- **Core concept**: Focus on "Where would you like to wake up tomorrow?" hook
- **Community building**: Emphasize station-based networking potential

### If Questions About Privacy
- **Anonymous first**: No personal data beyond station preferences
- **Email only for verification**: Deleted after Discord invitation
- **GDPR compliant**: Built-in privacy by design

### If Questions About Resources
- **Giovanni's capacity**: Existing server, Mapbox API, development skills
- **Timeline feasible**: 2-day MVP proven, summer for production
- **Integration ready**: Works with existing BoT infrastructure

### If Questions About Scope
- **Start simple**: Core functionality first, features added iteratively
- **Action Group control**: Regular feedback and strategic guidance
- **BoT alignment**: Supports existing advocacy, doesn't replace it

## Expected Questions & Responses

### "How do we prevent spam or fake submissions?"
*"Rate limiting, basic validation, and focus on aggregate data rather than individual submissions. Quality improves as real communities form."*

### "Will this compete with the main BoT website?"
*"No, it's a gateway. The platform links to policy papers, newsletter signup, and main website. It brings new people to BoT instead of competing."*

### "What if only rail enthusiasts use it?"
*"The romantic framing tests this assumption. If it doesn't break the bubble, we'll see low usage. But the cost is minimal and the upside is huge."*

### "How does this connect to actual policy work?"
*"Three ways: advocacy data for lobbying, grassroots pressure for politicians, and media stories about European travel dreams vs. reality."*
