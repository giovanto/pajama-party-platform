# 🚀 Branch Cleanup Execution Plan

## 📋 Current Situation
- **Root repo**: Contains V1/V2 legacy code (messy)
- **V3 subdirectory**: Contains production-ready Next.js 15 app
- **Goal**: Make V3 the clean main repository for public use

## 🎯 Strategy: Repository Restructure

Since V3 is in a subdirectory, we need to:
1. **Move V3 content to root** (make it the main repository)
2. **Archive legacy versions** in a separate branch
3. **Clean up branches** for public sharing

## 🚀 Execution Steps

### Step 1: Create Clean Repository Structure
We'll restructure so V3 becomes the root of the repository.

### Step 2: Archive Legacy Versions
Move V1/V2 to an archive branch for reference.

### Step 3: Clean Branch Structure
Delete old development branches and make clean main branch.

## 📁 Target Structure
```
pajama-party-platform/ (root)
├── app/ (Next.js V3 app)
├── src/ (V3 components)  
├── package.json (V3 dependencies)
├── README.md (V3 documentation)
├── vercel.json (V3 deployment config)
└── archive/ (V1/V2 for reference)
```

This will give you a clean repository that:
✅ Has V3 as the main codebase
✅ Can be deployed directly to Vercel
✅ Is public-ready and professional
✅ Keeps legacy versions for reference
