# 🧹 GitHub Repository Cleanup - Step by Step

## 🎯 **Goal: Clean Public Repository**

Transform your repository from development branches to a clean, professional public repository.

## 📋 **Current Branches to Clean**
```
✅ v3-nextjs-implementation (KEEP - Production ready)
❌ main (DELETE - old/messy)
❌ development (DELETE - legacy V1/V2)
❌ v2-development (DELETE - legacy V2)
```

## 🚀 **Step-by-Step Cleanup**

### **Step 1: Push Current V3 Work**
```bash
# Push the latest production-ready V3
git push origin v3-nextjs-implementation
```

### **Step 2: Go to GitHub Repository Settings**
1. Go to: https://github.com/giovanto/pajama-party-platform
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Default branch**
4. Change default branch from `main` to `v3-nextjs-implementation`
5. Click **Update** and confirm

### **Step 3: Archive Legacy Versions (Optional)**
```bash
# Create archive branch for V1/V2 history
git checkout main
git checkout -b archive/legacy-versions
echo "# Legacy Versions Archive

This branch contains V1 and V2 implementations for reference only.

- **V1:** Original implementation
- **V2:** Development iteration  
- **V3:** Current production (see main branch)

The main branch contains the production-ready V3 platform.
" > LEGACY_ARCHIVE.md
git add LEGACY_ARCHIVE.md
git commit -m "Archive V1 and V2 for historical reference"
git push origin archive/legacy-versions
```

### **Step 4: Delete Old Branches**

   - Delete these branches:
     - `main` (old)
     - `development` 
     - `v2-development`

2. **Or via command line:**
```bash
# Delete remote branches
git push origin --delete main
git push origin --delete development  
git push origin --delete v2-development

# Delete local branches
git branch -D main
git branch -D development
git branch -D v2-development
```

### **Step 5: Rename V3 Branch to Main**
1. **On GitHub web interface:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/giovanto/pajama-party-platform/branches
